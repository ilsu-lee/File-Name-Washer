# File Name Washer
*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [한국어](README.ko.md)*

When transferring a file with a Korean file name created on MacOS to Windows, this program converts the combination file name to a complete file name so that the characters are not separated.

*[Package Download](binary/File-Name-Washer.dmg)*

By default, a folder named "converted" is created under the selected folder when converting and the laundered files are saved.\
You can change the folder name. (You can only set it to English, not Korean. No special characters except dashes/hyphens.)\
If checked, you can overwrite to the same folder. (You can only select on a folder-by-folder basis because application R/W permissions will only occur under the folder/file you select)

Drag the files or folders you want to rename into the application window.
First, it checks for washable files and then proceeds with the conversion.
